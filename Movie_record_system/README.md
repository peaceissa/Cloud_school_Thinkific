# Movie Record System

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a Movie Record System on a Linux operating system and utilize Git and GitHub for version control. This hands-on project aims to provide students with practical experience in Linux file management, basic command-line operations, and versioning using Git.

## System Setup
1. Install a Linux operating system of your choice on a virtual machine or your own computer.

## Project Structure
The Movie Record System will have the following directory structure:

```
Movie-Record-System/
├── movies/
│   ├── moviex/
│   │   ├── movie_x1.txt
│   │   ├── movie_x2.txt
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── moviey/
│   │   ├── movie_y1.txt
│   │   ├── movie_y2.txt
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── series/
    ├── seriesa/
    │   ├── series_a1.txt
    │   ├── series_a2.txt
    │   └── ...
    ├── seriesb/
    │   ├── series_b1.txt
    │   ├── series_b2.txt
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
```

## Instructions

### 1. Linux File System Setup
   - Utilize your knowledge of Linux file types and hierarchy to create the Movie-Record-System directory.
   - Inside the Movie-Record-System directory, create two sub-directories: `movies` and `series`.

### 2. Movie Record Management
   - Within the `movies` directory, create sub-directories for each movie series (e.g., moviex, moviey).
   - Inside each movie series directory, create movie files (e.g., movie_x1.txt, movie_x2.txt).

### 3. Series Record Management
   - Within the `series` directory, create sub-directories for each series (e.g., seriesa, seriesb).
   - Inside each series directory, create series files (e.g., series_a1.txt, series_a2.txt).

### 4. Basic Linux Commands
   - Use basic Linux commands for file and directory management (create, edit, move, delete) to organize the Movie Record System.

### 5. Git and GitHub Integration
   - Create a GitHub repository to store your Movie Record System.
   - Initialize a Git repository within your Movie-Record-System directory.
   - Commit your changes using meaningful commit messages.
   - Use Git to push and pull changes to and from your GitHub repository.

## Desired Output
Upon completion of the project, your Movie Record System should resemble the directory structure outlined above, with organized movie and series directories, each containing relevant text files. Additionally, the project should be versioned and stored on GitHub.

Feel free to explore additional Linux commands and Git features to enhance your understanding and skills throughout the project.
